This directory contains JavaScript examples of querying DB Relay server using:

* [only jQuery, XSS demonstrated](bare_employees.html)
* [as presented at OSCON 2010](oscon2010.html)
* [ExtJS (a.k.a Sencha) data source](extjs_employees.html)

The [ExtJS example without DB Relay] is provided to help evaluate relative overhead of using DB Relay. If you are on OS X, use the `opendiff extjs_employees_no_dbrelay.html extjs_employees.html` command, of similar diff command on other platforms.
